 <p> Overview: I researched datasets mostly from New Yotk state in order to analyze crime trends. My overall Hypothesis is that Crime in New YorkCity does not just need police to stopcrime. There are other factors like quality of living, flawed government officials amongst many others. I utilized Python; specifically the pandas, matplotlib and numpy libraries. </p>

<h1> Data: </h1>
 <p>https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/historical.page : This is the most important dataset I worked with.This allowed me to gain a bigger picture of the crime in New York and what to analyze next. Crimes were broken down into four catergories: seven major felonies, non-seven major felonies, misdemeanors and city-wide violations. I utilized the citywide toget the best bigger picture of crime in New York City possible.</p>

 <p>https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/civilian-complaints-against-new-york-city-police-officers : While most of us associate police with crime prevention I wanted to see if the ooposite was true. This dataset gives information of complaints againstpolice officers. This dataset allows us to gain perspective of details of negative altercations with the police. This includes detailed information on both the officer, victim, year and precinct.</p>

 <h1>Techniques</h1>
<p>I utilized python in order to Analyze the data. I used matplotlib To visualize my findings and test my hyopthesis. For datacollection my main sources were any NYC offical websites along with Kaggle. I searched google for key terms that. were relavent to the things I wanted to research. Once data was found it was analyzed and visualized. </p>
